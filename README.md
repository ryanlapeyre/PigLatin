# PigLatin
A tiny exercise made in Python to practice. Glad I did this in Python and not C, it made things a bit easier. Deals with vowels and consonants translations in Pig Latin. I might revisit this project to add functionality for consonant clusters; I could not find a concrete list at the time but perhaps later I will.
